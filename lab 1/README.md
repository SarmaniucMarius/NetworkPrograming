# Lab 1

The task is to make http requests to a server and save all the data from the routes.
Routes have timeoutes and in order to reduce from waiting time we had to use concurrecny,
all the data has to be saved in less then 20 seconds. Once the data is saved, it has to be
converted in a common format. This information has to be accesible through telnet. Sending
this data has to be concurrent too.
